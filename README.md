# airlineDelay Analysis

As a boy scout since young, I enjoy traveling often. To maximize my opportunity for travel, I often select airlines that have the best services and least delays.

In this repo, I utilized linear regression and econometric techniques to treat violations of Gauss-Markov assumptions, while finding the airlines and times with least delays.

I also made a dashboard to visualize some of the important metrics on PowerBI.

Delay metrics by time is also shown. You can filter by specific airlines, delay metrics, and through the visuals as well!
