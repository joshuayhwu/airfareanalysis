# airlineDelay Analysis

As a boy scout since young, I enjoy traveling often. To maximize my opportunity for travel, I often find airlines that have the best services and least delays.

In this repo, I utilized linera regression and econometric techniques to treat violations of Gauss-Markov assumptions, while finding the airlines and times with least delays.

I also made a dashboard to visualize these relationships on PowerBI.
